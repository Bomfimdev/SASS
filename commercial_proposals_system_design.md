# Commercial Proposals System - Architecture Design

## Implementation approach

After analyzing the requirements, I propose a modern, scalable architecture for the Commercial Proposals System with these key components:

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js for API development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage with multi-tenant isolation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **API Architecture**: RESTful API with clear resource-based endpoints
- **ORM**: Sequelize for database interactions and migrations
- **Multi-tenancy**: Schema-based multi-tenant isolation for data security

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with functional components and hooks
- **State Management**: Redux for global state management
- **UI Components**: Material-UI for consistent design
- **Form Handling**: Formik with Yup validation
- **API Communication**: Axios for HTTP requests

### Deployment & DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent environments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Hosting**: AWS or similar cloud provider

## Key Technical Considerations

### Multi-tenant Security
- Each tenant (company) will have isolated data using PostgreSQL schemas
- Middleware will enforce tenant-level data access based on authenticated user
- All database queries will be automatically scoped to the appropriate tenant

### Performance Optimization
- Implement data caching with Redis for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Optimize database queries with appropriate indexes
- Implement frontend code splitting for faster initial load times

### Scalability
- Stateless API design allows for horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling to handle increased concurrent users
- Consider eventual implementation of microservices for specific high-load features

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Core Authentication & Multi-tenant System**: Implement secure login, registration, and tenant isolation
2. **Proposal Management**: CRUD operations for proposals with template functionality
3. **User & Role Management**: Admin interface for managing users and permissions
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Implement dashboard with key metrics
5. **Integration Points**: Implement APIs for third-party integrations
